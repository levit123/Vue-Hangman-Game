# Vue Hangman Game
Recreation of the game "Hangman". Made using the Vue javascript framework 2.6.1. Uses a CDN to reference the Vue framework hosted on Cloudflare. Uses the Vue framework to instantiate a Vue app and it's components, and bind it's data and functionality to the HTML elements. The game chooses one of several pre-defined words, and the player must guess what the letters are. With each incorrect guess, the Javascript code will draw another part of the hangman on the canvas. There is also a two-player mode, where one player types a word of their own choosing into the Alert prompt, and the other player must guess the letters of the word.
